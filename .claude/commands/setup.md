# /setup - First-Run Onboarding

Guide the user through setting up their Personal OS. One step at a time. Wait for input before moving on.

Prerequisites (done before running /setup):
- MCP connections (Gmail, Calendar, Notion) authenticated via /mcp
- If something isn't connected, the system still works. Don't ask them to set up missing connections.

## Step 1: Install Skills + Verify Connections

Silently install skills via Bash (don't show full output):
```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/anthropics/skills --skill pptx --yes --global 2>&1 | tail -1
npx skills add https://github.com/anthropics/skills --skill xlsx --yes --global 2>&1 | tail -1
npx skills add https://github.com/claude-office-skills/skills --skill ppt-visual --yes --global 2>&1 | tail -1
npx skills add https://github.com/claude-office-skills/skills --skill xlsx-manipulation --yes --global 2>&1 | tail -1
```
Tell the user: "Installed PowerPoint and Excel skills for branded output generation."

Test connections:
- Try Gmail MCP: list 1 recent email subject
- Try Calendar MCP: check today's events
- Try Notion MCP: list databases

Report: "I can see your [Gmail/Calendar/Notion]. [Anything not connected] isn't set up but we can work without it."

## Step 2: Build Identity

Tell the user, exactly:

```
Let's build your identity. Two ways to feed me:

1. Drop files into the inbox/ folder — resume, LinkedIn export, writing samples,
   transcripts, bio, decks, anything that helps me know you. PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT
   all work. I'll read everything in there.
2. Paste text directly into the chat.

You can do both. When you're ready, type 'go'. If you want to skip the inbox
and just chat, type 'chat'.
```

**WAIT for the user to type 'go' or 'chat'.** Do not proceed.

### A. Read the inbox (if they typed 'go')

List `inbox/`. Skip dotfiles like `.gitkeep`. For every other file:
- Read it. PDFs use the pdf skill, DOCX uses the docx skill, plain text/markdown via Read.
- Track filenames in a "what I read" list to show the user.

If the inbox has no real files (only `.gitkeep` or empty), tell them: "Inbox is empty. Drop files now and type 'go' again, or paste your info in the chat." Then WAIT.

### B. Extract + smart questions

After reading inbox files (or chat input), extract: role, company, writing style, priorities, people, projects. Then ONLY ask for what's missing:

- If you got their role from the resume, don't ask again.
- If you got their company from LinkedIn, don't ask again.
- Always ask about personality: "If your agent was a character, who would it be? Jarvis? A chill surfer? A sharp colleague? Describe the vibe."
- Always ask about goals if not clear: "What are your current goals? Work, personal, learning?"
- If writing samples weren't in inbox or chat: "Paste 5-10 things you've actually written. Posts, tweets, emails. I need your real voice."

Aim for 3-5 questions total. Skip what you already know.

### C. Sanity check on input quality (do NOT skip)

Before moving to Step 3, verify you have real material. Required:
- At least one of: resume / LinkedIn / bio / detailed self-description.
- A character/personality answer (not one word).
- At least one concrete goal.
- Writing samples: 3+ snippets, or one long piece.

If anything is missing, thin, or looks like filler ("idk", "whatever", single word answers), push back: "I need more on [X] before I can build a real soul.md. Otherwise you'll get a generic agent." Then WAIT for more input. Do NOT proceed with thin material.

## Step 3: Brand Setup

YOU MUST STOP AND ASK THE USER. Do NOT skip this step automatically.

Tell the user and WAIT for their response:
"Before I build your vault, let's set up your brand. Your brand/ folder has default templates (logo, PPT template, Excel template). Every report, deck, and Excel I generate uses these.

You have two options:
1. **Replace with your own**: Drop your logo into brand/images/ and your PPT template into brand/templates/. Type 'done' when you've dropped them.
2. **Use the defaults**: Type 'skip' and I'll use what's already here. You can update later with /brand.

Which one?"

WAIT for the user to respond. Do not proceed until they say "done" or "skip" or something equivalent.

If they say "done" or indicate they dropped files:
- Scan brand/images/ for new files. Scan brand/templates/ for new .pptx or .xlsx.
- If new PPT found: open with python-pptx, extract colors, fonts, layout. Update brand/config/brand-config.md.
- If new PPT but no new Excel: "I see your PPT template. I'll create a matching Excel template." Generate it.
- If new images but no new PPT: "I see your logo. What are your brand colors (hex codes) and preferred fonts?" Then generate PPT and Excel templates.
- Confirm: "Brand updated. Here's what I'm using: [colors], [fonts], [templates]."

If they say "skip":
- "Using default brand. Run /brand anytime to update with your own assets."

## Step 4: Ingest Identity Into the Wiki (Karpathy Pattern)

### A. Run /ingest on the inbox

Run the `/ingest --batch` flow from `.claude/commands/ingest.md` against everything in `inbox/`. That command handles archiving (move to `vault/sources/`), manifest tracking (`inbox/_ingested.md`), wiki page creation, and `[[wiki links]]`. Pasted chat text is saved to `inbox/onboarding-chat.md` first, then ingested too.

After this step, all inbox files have been archived to `vault/sources/`, the manifest is up to date, and entity pages exist for every person/company/project mentioned.

### B. Write soul.md

OVERWRITE the template. Fill in EVERY section from what you collected in Step 2.

Generate the **Agent Personality** section using meta-prompting:
- Core identity (one sentence)
- How you talk (4-5 specific rules)
- Addressing style
- Emotional range
- 5 example responses (calibration examples, the model mimics these)
- Anti-patterns (character-specific things this voice would NEVER do)
- Voice rules (keep defaults + character-specific additions)
- Things I Never Want (inferred from character and writing style)

soul.md MUST be fully filled. No placeholders. Under 2.5KB.

### C. Top-up wiki pages from soul.md

`/ingest` already created entity pages for everyone/everything mentioned in the sources. Now add the user-specific pages that didn't have an obvious source mention:
- `vault/me/role.md`, `vault/me/goals.md`, `vault/me/preferences.md` — from soul.md and chat answers.
- Cross-reference these to the entity pages already created (`[[business/company]]`, `[[people/name]]`).

### D. Index and log

`/ingest` already updated `vault/index.md` and `vault/log.md`. Verify the user-specific pages from step C are also listed in the index. Append a final `## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] /setup | onboarding complete` entry to `vault/log.md`.

### E. Verify (no-dummy gate — do NOT skip)

Before declaring Step 4 done, run this check on what you just wrote. If ANY check fails, fix it before continuing.

1. **soul.md placeholder scan.** Read soul.md. Fail if it contains any of: `TODO`, `TBD`, `FIXME`, `[your `, `[name]`, `<placeholder`, `lorem ipsum`, `Jane Doe`, `John Doe`, `example.com`, empty headed sections like `## Goals\n\n## ` (heading followed immediately by another heading).
2. **Real names.** Every `vault/people/*.md` filename must be a real name from the inbox or chat. No `person-1.md`, `placeholder.md`, `example.md`.
3. **Non-empty pages.** Every wiki page has > 50 chars of actual body (not just frontmatter + a heading).
4. **Cross-references.** Every page has at least one `[[wiki link]]` to another page (except `vault/index.md` and `vault/log.md`).
5. **Source provenance.** soul.md and the vault pages cite or reflect content from `vault/sources/`. If you couldn't extract a fact, leave the field absent — do NOT invent.
6. **Voice match.** soul.md's example responses use the user's actual writing style from samples, not generic Claude phrasing.

If any check fails: report exactly which one, fix it (re-read sources, ask a targeted question, rewrite the offending file), then re-run the check. Do not move to Step 5 until all six pass.

### F. Show the user

Read soul.md back. Then list the vault pages you created with their cross-references. Ask: "Does this sound like you? Anything to fix?" WAIT for confirmation or edits before Step 5.

## Step 5: Initialize Notion Workspace + Project Tracker

Create a "Personal OS" parent page in Notion. ALL future databases live under this page.
Store parent page ID in vault/projects/notion-parent-id.md.

Under the parent page, create "Progress Tracker" database: Task (title), Status (select: To Do/In Progress/Done), Order (number), Notes (text).
Views: "Board" (grouped by Status), "Build Order" (table sorted by Order).

Seed with 10 automations:
1. Sprint Tracker → To Do
2. Morning Brief → To Do
3. Market Pulse → To Do
4. Research Team → To Do
5. Personal CRM → To Do
6. Meeting Intel → To Do
7. Email Triage → To Do
8. Expense Wrangler → To Do
9. Content Machine → To Do
10. Weekly Exec Report → To Do

Store database ID in vault/projects/sprint-tracker/status.md.

Share the Notion link with the user so they can see the board: "Here's your progress tracker: [link]. 10 automations to build."

## Step 6: Set Up Obsidian

"Open Obsidian. Open folder as vault. Navigate to the vault/ folder. You'll see your pages and the graph."

## Step 7: Done

Summary:
- Connections: [list]
- soul.md: filled in with [personality name] personality
- Brand: [set up with custom / using defaults]
- Project tracker: [Notion link], 10 automations seeded
- Vault: [X pages] created
- Obsidian: ready

### Final message — branch on what's in work/

Run `ls work/` and check what's there:

**If `work/` has folders like `01-sprint-tracker/`, `02-morning-brief/`, etc. (this is `personal-os-prebuilt` or `personal-os-prebuilt-free`):**

Tell the user, exactly:
```
Your Personal OS is ready. The automations are pre-built — no prompts to run.

Try any of these commands. Each one runs Step 0 (Bootstrap) on first invocation
to create its Notion DB lazily, then does its job:

  /sprint-tracker      — read the progress board, generate a standup
  /morning-brief       — today's emails + calendar digest
  /market-pulse        — competitor scan
  /research-team       — multi-agent research on a topic
  /meeting-intel       — pre-meeting dossier or post-meeting extraction
  /personal-crm        — sync contacts and stage follow-up drafts
  /email-triage        — classify Gmail and draft replies
  /expense-wrangler    — process receipts, generate Excel report
  /content-machine     — turn any source into a content kit
  /weekly-exec-report  — Friday capstone deck across all 9

Optional admin: /brand, /ingest, /lint, /status, /cron-setup, /venture-sync.
```

**If `work/` is empty or doesn't exist (this is the bare `personal-os` template):**

Find the prompts folder. Try these candidate paths in order, stop at the first that contains `01-sprint-tracker/prompt_1_build.md`:
1. `../prompts/`
2. `../../prompts/`
3. `~/Desktop/prompts/`
4. `~/Downloads/prompts/`

Use Bash to test: `[ -f <candidate>/01-sprint-tracker/prompt_1_build.md ] && echo FOUND <candidate>`. If found, capture the absolute path. If none match, set PROMPTS_PATH to "(not found)".

Tell the user, substituting `{PROMPTS_PATH}`:

```
Your Personal OS skeleton is ready. No automations are built yet.

Build path: paste prompts one at a time, in order.

Found prompts folder: {PROMPTS_PATH}

Start here:
   open {PROMPTS_PATH}/01-sprint-tracker/prompt_1_build.md
   copy the contents, paste into chat.

The agent will build Sprint Tracker via /new (creates work/01-sprint-tracker/,
the command spec, and the Notion DB). When it marks itself Done on the board,
move to 02-morning-brief, then 03-market-pulse, all the way through 11.

Eleven prompts total. By the end your install will match personal-os-prebuilt.
```

If PROMPTS_PATH is "(not found)", say instead:

```
Your Personal OS skeleton is ready. No automations are built yet.

I couldn't find the prompts/ folder. It usually ships alongside personal-os/
as a sibling directory. Where did you save it? Paste the path or drop the
folder next to personal-os/ and tell me when ready.

If you don't have prompts/, you can still build free-form: run /new and
describe what you want. Sprint Tracker is a good first build:
  /new sprint tracker
```

Either way, end with: "Welcome aboard."
